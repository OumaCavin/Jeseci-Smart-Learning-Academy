fix(community): resolve connection status bug and remove duplicate walkers

- Fix incorrect column index in collaboration_store.py where status field
  was reading row[2] instead of row[1], causing status to always return null
- Remove duplicate deprecated walker definitions (forums_list, connections_list,
  connection_requests) from app.jac that used hardcoded mock data instead of
  database queries
- Ensure Community navigation item returns proper connection status values
