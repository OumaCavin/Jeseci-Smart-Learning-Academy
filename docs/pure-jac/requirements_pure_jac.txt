# JAC Language Runtime 
jaclang>=0.9.3
jac-client>=0.2.3  # Client-side runtime for JAC frontend components

# --- Manually Expanded 'jac-cloud' Dependencies ---
# These replace the 'jac-cloud' package to bypass version conflicts.
# ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: The actual 'jac-cloud' library code is NOT included here.
# If jac serve relies on logic inside jac-cloud, it may fail or function differently.
# This creates a custom environment that mimics jac-cloud without the package itself.
