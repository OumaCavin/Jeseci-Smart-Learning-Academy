| Authentication Flow | [auth_flow.mmd](./mermaid/auth_flow.mmd) | Sequence diagram of user registration and login processes |
| Database Schema | [db_schema.mmd](./mermaid/db_schema.mmd) | Entity-relationship diagram for PostgreSQL and Neo4j schemas |
| Activity Diagram | [activity_diagram.mmd](./mermaid/activity_diagram.mmd) | User learning journey flowchart |
| Class Diagram | [class_diagram.mmd](./mermaid/class_diagram.mmd) | Jaclang walkers and data model class relationships |
| Component Diagram | [component_diagram.mmd](./mermaid/component_diagram.mmd) | System components and their interactions |
| Deployment Architecture | [deployment_architecture.mmd](./mermaid/deployment_architecture.mmd) | Production deployment with Docker containers |
| Multi-Agent System | [multi_agent_system.mmd](./mermaid/multi_agent_system.mmd) | Agent coordination and knowledge sources |
| Sequence Diagram | [sequence_diagram.mmd](./mermaid/sequence_diagram.mmd) | Detailed login process sequence |

## Using the Diagrams

### Viewing Mermaid Diagrams

All diagrams are written in Mermaid.js syntax. You can view them using:

1. **VS Code**: Install "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension
2. **Online**: Copy content to [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/)
3. **Documentation**: Refer to [ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](./ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
