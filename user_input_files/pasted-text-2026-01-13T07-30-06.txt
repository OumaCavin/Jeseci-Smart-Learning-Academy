I'll help you update those files from the extracted files in the cloud sandbox and push them to the remote repository.

So the file is at /workspace/backend/app.jac. Let me try again with the correct path.

I see - the git repository in /workspace/frontend is actually a frontend-only repository (it has src/, package.json, etc. but no backend/ directory). The backend files are in a separate directory at /workspace/backend/.
This is a monorepo setup where:

Frontend code is in /workspace/frontend (git repo)
Backend code is in /workspace/backend (not a git repo)
The user wants to update backend files, but those files aren't tracked in the git repository. This is a problem because the git repo only tracks frontend files.

Let me check if maybe there's a backend subdirectory in the frontend git repo that I'm missing, or if the user wants me to add the backend directory to the git repo.

It seems the backend files are not in the git repository at all. The repository at /workspace/frontend only contains frontend files.
Looking back at the earlier extraction, I remember seeing backend files in the git status when I ran git status in /workspace/frontend. Let me check if maybe the backend files were added to the staging area but not committed.

Actually, I think I understand now. When we extracted the files, the git repository had many backend files staged (from the initial extraction), but after the rebase abort, those changes were lost.

The issue is that the git repository at /workspace/frontend is supposed to be a monorepo containing both frontend and backend, but currently it only has frontend files tracked.

I need to:

1.
Add the backend directory structure to the git repository
2.
Copy the backend files from /workspace/backend/ to /workspace/frontend/backend/
3.
Stage and commit them
4.
Push to remote
Let me try this approach.

I see the issue - the git repository currently only tracks frontend files. Let me add the backend directory structure to track those files:

Completed Command Line Execution
mkdir -p /workspace/frontend/backend

cp -r /workspace/backend/* /workspace/frontend/backend/
